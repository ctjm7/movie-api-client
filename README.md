# See You at the Movies!

This is an application using React to access a REST API and database. It uses React to build the client-side for the application. The application utilizes the tech stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).

## Description
This is a client-side application using React. It is based on an existing server-side code that was created using a REST API and database.

## Purpose of the App
This app is was developed to be introduced to React while recreating a client side application that was previously done using React. This is to allow learning Angular in an environment that I am already familiar. This application allows users to view a list of movies. The information provided is a movie description, genre details, and director information. The user can create a profile, update their information and add movies to a favorites list.
